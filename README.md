# Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adam

I'm a software developer based near Manchester, UK.

After finishing my A-Levels, to fulfil my passion for technology and computer science, I decided to pursue a career in software engineering. I did this by completing a software developer apprenticeship working in partnership with Manchester Digital. Since then, I have continued my career as a professional developer, responsible for creating and maintaining digital products for a FTSE 100 company.

During my time as a professional developer, I've gained experience through exposure to a wide range of technologies and frameworks, including React, Next, TypeScript, Node, GraphQL, and more.

This project powers my personal website, which you can find at [adamrutherford.dev](https://adamrutherford.dev).

This is a Next.js project, hosted on Vercel.

I've used TypeScript, as it's much more robust than regular JS. I've tried to keep as many of my components and functions as strongly typed as possible.

I've also used Styled Components with theming to keep my app consistent and maintainable. At the moment, I only have a single theme for colours and spacing, looking to expand this in the future.
