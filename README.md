# Welcome to the code behind my site!

This is a Next.js project, hosted on Vercel.

I've used TypeScript, as it's much more robust than regular JS. I've tried to keep as many of my components and functions as strongly typed as possible.

I've also used Styled Components with theming to keep my app consistent and maintainable. At the moment, I only have a single theme for colours and spacing, looking to expand this in the future.
